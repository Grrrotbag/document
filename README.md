# Overview

This project serves as a template to be used for creating documents. It's for my own personal use, including styling that I prefer, but anyone is free to use this. Whatever the least restrictive terms available are---that's what this repository is covered by. Fill your boots.

## Requirements

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) to visit the website. Specifically, I am using `xelatex` as the pdf-engine to use system fonts.

## Outline

You can overwrite the text in this document using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is extremely simple. View the documentation for more detail on how to use Markdown.

The beauty of this setup is that, thanks to pandoc, you can use Markdown and \LaTeX\ in the same document to produce beautiful documents incredibly easily.
