# Overview

This project serves as a template to be used for creating documents. It's for my own personal use, including styling that I prefer, but anyone is free to use this. Whatever the least restrictive terms available are---that's what this repository is covered by. Fill your boots.

## Requirements

- Pandoc --- [Link](https://pandoc.org/)
- \LaTeX\ --- [Link](https://www.latex-project.org/) to visit the website. Specifically, I am using `xelatex` as the pdf-engine to use system fonts.

## Outline

You can overwrite the text in this document using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is extremely simple. View the documentation for more detail on how to use Markdown.

The beauty of this setup is that, thanks to pandoc, you can use Markdown and \LaTeX\ in the same document to produce beautiful documents incredibly easily.

# Usage

There is a separate `YAML` file called `metadata.yaml` which contains a few variables. There are a few obvious ones, such as:

## Document Metadata

```YAML
author: Gerard Keane
title: Document Title
date: \today
```

Hopefully these are self-explanatory. If you want, you can write dates in the following format:

```YAML
date: 7^th^ April 2019
```

Which will produce a date like this: 

7^th^ April 2019. 

If you leave it alone you will get today's date in the format: 

\today.

## Table of Contents

The table of contents (*toc*), list of tables (*lot*) and list of figures (*lof*) can be automatically generated by using the following lines:

```YAML
lot: false
toc: true
lof: false
```

They will be on a separate page from the title thanks to the following line in the YAML header, which you shouldn't touch.

```YAML
include-before:
- '`\newpage{}`{=latex}'
```

## Typography

The fonts used by the document are controlloed by the following variables:

```YAML
mainfont: "Hoefler Text"
sansfont: "Helvetica Neue"
monofont: "Fira Code"
```

`Mainfont` represents the body text of the document. `Sansfont` is used for the section headers throughout, and `monofont` is used for representing code, such as the blocks you can see in this section.

You can use any font installed on your system for these.

The fontsize is obviously set by:

```YAML
fontsize: 12pt
```

## Margins

The document is set to have 3cm margins all around the document. Set by the following line:

```YAML
geometry: [top=3cm, bottom=3cm, left=3cm, right=3cm]
```

## \LaTeX\ Magic

The few minor alterations I have made to the default pandoc template are included in the section `header-includes`, as below:

```YAML
header-includes:
  # Setting The Title Styling to Gill Sans
  - \newfontfamily\headingfont[]{Gill Sans}
  - \usepackage{titling}
  - \pretitle{\begin{center}\headingfont\Huge\MakeUppercase}
  - \posttitle{\end{center}\vspace{2em}}
  # Setting the section heading styling to Helvetica
  - \usepackage{sectsty}
  - \allsectionsfont{\sffamily}
```

Since pandoc uses \LaTeX\ to generate pdfs, one can use any \LaTeX\ package in the manner described above. This is an extremely powerful tool and I urge you to examine the possibilities of this if you are in any way interested in further customising this document. There's a whole world out there.

I have set the title to use Gill Sans, and ensured that it is all uppercase. I have also set the section headings to use the sans-serif font as per the `Typography` section above.

You can alter these however you like, I simply prefer the aesthetic of sans-serif headers and serif body text.
